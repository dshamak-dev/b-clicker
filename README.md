# TODO
1. MVP Required 
  - add animals (dogs) to the game
  - add character comments grouped by event type
  - update sprites
  - add build minification and public folder as destination
2. MVP Optional
  - calculate path through collisions
  - add door animations and logic to block animals
  - scoreboard online
  - score sharing through Babz's instagram

# Ideas
  - poke animal will force it to go closer to the exit (change position will leave)
  - some quests can randomly leave door open for animals
  - closed doors can affect characters inside (add inside temperature)
  - can use small game to remember gust order
  - add Scum character (negative actions)
  - add commands for worker character as special skills
